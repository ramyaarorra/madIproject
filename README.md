# madIproject
oh this is the first project i made as a part of my diploma in programming :D

This project aims to make self-learning and self-testing for students more accessible by the means of provision of questions and the power to design a test for themselves as per requirements.
Further, Tutors can track progress of their students to ensure proper learning and understanding.
This fosters the concept of self-studies while also leaving scope of guidance via mentors. 

Technologies used
1. Flask
2. Flask extensions (Jinja2)
3. SQLite
4. Matplotlib
5. Python Libraries

The project is implemented in a way which enables the users to learn and practice entirely on their own.

Abilities of Users
1. Users are able to login and practice quizzes, based on subjects and chapters of their choice. A notable feature is that users have the ability to practice questions of 1, 2, or 3 chapters at once. They can choose the number of questions they want to practice. By default, Users get 2 minutes per questions.
2. Users can also see their past attempts, how their accuracy has improved over time by the use of line graph.
3. 
Abilities of Admin
1. Admin is the super-user who actually creates the users. Admin can manage users and add remarks for them.
2. Admin can create new subjects or update, delete pre-existing ones.
3. Admin can create new, update or delete chapters (sub-division of subjects). Chapters of only those subjects can be made, which exist already.
4. Admin can create new, update or delete questions (sub-division of chapters). New questions can be added for pre-existing chapters and subjects.
5. Admins can track progress of users, in comparison to each other as well as see individual progress.
